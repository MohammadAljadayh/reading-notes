# GitHub Pages

if you're already using github it's the  most direct path to create websites for
you and your projects so how does it work.  

github serves all of your project sites from a personal URL tied to your user name or organization github
looks for web content for your projects on a special branch for sites tied to an  existing repository this branch is
separate from your code but you can also  create a site for yourself or your organization by creating a repository

using GitHub Pages  frees you up to focus on the content of your site instead of worrying
about how you'll get it from your computer to everyone else's browser
