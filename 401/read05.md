# Data Modeling

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

- Better program design and higher code quality.
-  Save project costs in the long run.
- TDD reduces the time required for project development.

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- If need to setup a mock object or  and this object  can be reused by all the tests units


## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

When feature changes, implementation will change as well, and many test cases will fail

The downside to TDD is that it is usually tightly associated with 'Agile' methodology, which places no importance on documentation of a system, rather the understanding behind why a test 'should' return one specific value rather than any other resides only in the developer's head.


### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

A child of an ES6 class is another type definition which extends the parent with new properties and methods, which in turn can be instantiated at runtime. ... A class constructor creates an instance of the class. A constructor in JavaScript is just a plain old function that returns an object.



### ”Why REST?”

- 1) REST is Easy to Understand and Implement
- 2) REST Makes your Application More Scalable
 - 3) Caching is Easier with REST
- 4) REST is Flexibile

## *Document the following Vocabulary Terms*

``functional programming``

 functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

``object-oriented programming (OOP)``

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

``class``

A class is the description of a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, methods, relationships and semantics. A class may use a set of interfaces to specify collections of operations it provides to its environment.

``super``

 keyword to call the constructor of the super class.

``this``

In the global execution context (outside of any function), this refers to the global object whether in strict mode or not.


``Test Driven Development``

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed

``Jest``

JEST is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity and test runner mainly for creating, running, and structuring tests. JEST is distributed as an NPM / YARN package, you can install it in any JavaScript projec

``Continuous Integration (CI)``

Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.

``REST``

Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave.

``Data Model``

A data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. ... The term data model can refer to two distinct but closely related concepts
