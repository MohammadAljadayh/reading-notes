- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an - - exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

- LILO : Last In Last Out


### what is the difference between queues and Stacks?
A stack is an ordered list of elements where all insertions and deletions are made at the same end, whereas a queue is exactly the opposite of a stack which is open at both the ends meaning one end is used to insert data while the other to remove data.
