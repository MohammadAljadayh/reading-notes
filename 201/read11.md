### controlling sizes of images in Css 

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.  

### AlligNing images Using Css  

the float property can be used
to move an element to the left or
the right of its containing block,
allowing text to flow around it.
Rather than using the <img>
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved 

### Centering images Using Css 

By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.  

-  On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
- On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto. 

### Background Images
background-image   
The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.
