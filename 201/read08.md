# Layout

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
-  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
-  The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
-  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
-  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
-  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
-  CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
-  You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

- A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer:
There are tons of different layout designs to choose from. However, the structure above, is one of the most common.

- Controlling the
Position of Elements 

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: 
- normal flow :  
position:static   

- relative positioning: 
position:relative   

-  and absolute : 
position:absolute 

- Fixed Positioning :   
position:fixed

#### Screen Sizes
 Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.

#### Screen Resolution
 Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.   

#### Page Sizes

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide

### Layout Grids 

Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers

### CSS Frameworks 

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
