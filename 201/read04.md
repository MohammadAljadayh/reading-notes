# links 

Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.


- Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

# Layout 
Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper).


#### HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
- <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
- <nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
- <section> - Defines a section in a document
- <article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
- <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- <details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
- <summary> - Defines a heading for the 
- <details> element

### HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

- CSS framework
If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a CSS framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.
- CSS float property
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility. Learn more about float in our CSS Float and Clear chapter.
- CSS flexbox
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
- CSS grid
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

## Functions

 let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

#### JavaScript Function Syntax
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

- Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

- Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.


- Function Return
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

##### Why Functions?
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
