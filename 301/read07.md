- ### Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy T. Fielding, Senior Principal Scientist at Adobe, is known for his pioneering work on the World Wide Web, open source, and software architecture. He wrote the standards for HTTP/1. x and URI, has been a contributor to many other Web technologies, and defined the REST architectural style. 

- ### Why don't the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

when  started building the web , being able to talk to any machine was a primary concern. 


- ### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
 
The web page just specifies the URLs to the images for example and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed
