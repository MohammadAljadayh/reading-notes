##  In memory storage

- ## What is a call ?

is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

- ## How many calls can happen at once?

only one function..

- ## What does LIFO mean?

LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns
Example : 
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
       
- ## Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
