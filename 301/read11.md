- ###  What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries 


- ### 2. Give a real world example.
MySql . 

- ### 3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries

- ### 4. Give a real world example.

Mongodb .

- ### 5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage 

- ### 6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic



- ### 1.What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

- ### 2.What is a realational database? 

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. ... The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.
- ### 3.What type of structure does a relational database work with?

One-to-One One-to-Many Many-to-Many 

- ### 4.What is a ‘schema’?
The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS).  A cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information.

- ### 5.What is a NoSQL database?
 NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables
 
- ### 6.How does it work?
NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. ... They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
We have collections, and inside them we have documents where the data is assigned


- ### 7.What is inside of a Mongo database?

colloections and inside them there is docouments

- ### 8.Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB-because you don’t have to use a Schema

- ### 9.What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

- NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don’t support ACID).
This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
- In order to support ACID developers will have to implement their own code, making their systems more complex.
This may reduce the number of safe applications that commit transactions, for example bank systems.
- NoSQL is not compatible (at all) with SQL.
- Note: Some NoSQL management systems do use a Structured Query Language.
This means that you will need a manual query language, making things slower and more complex.
- NoSQL are very new compared to Relational Databases, which means that are far less stable and may have a lot less functionalities.
