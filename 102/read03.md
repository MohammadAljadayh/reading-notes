**Wireframing** is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

**HTML** is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way  

- **The main parts of our element are as follows:**  
1- The opening tag  
2- The closing tag  
3- The content  
4- The element  

- **There is two tybe of elements**  
1- Nesting elements   
for example :  put elements inside other elements like   
*<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p> * 

2- Empty elements : Some elements have no content like      
*<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">*

# Semantics

![S](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*zHJFnu7QF-PgUb8108aLcA.png)

 **Semantics** refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

 - **Semantics in HTML**   
 In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."  


 - **benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:**
- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated  

- **Semantic elements** 
These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available: 
- <article>
- <aside>
- <details>
- <figcaption>
- <figure>
- <footer>
- <header>
- <main>
- <mark>
- <nav>
- <section>
- <summary>
- <time>
