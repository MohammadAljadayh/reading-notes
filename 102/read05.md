# operators and Loops
 ## Expressions and operators
 - ### Operators
 JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.  
 **There  are a lot type of operator like : **
-  Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators .. etc.

### Expressions

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

#### JavaScript has the following expression categories:

- Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)
- String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)
- Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)
- Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
- Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.

## Loops and iteration 

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop

There are many different kinds of loops we will focus at : 
- for statement :  
 A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

  A for statement looks as follows:

 ** for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement ** 
  
  - while statement:  
  A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.   
  
  A while statement looks as follows:

   **while (condition)
    statement**
